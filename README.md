# Louvain-Girvan-Newman-Which-one-is-better-for-a-large-social-network-
This project compares the performance of the Louvain and Girvan-Newman algorithms for community detection on a large Facebook social network dataset.

Dataset:
 - Facebook network with 4,039 nodes and 88,324 edges
 - 10 subnets representing communities
   
Methods:
 - Louvain: Modularity optimization
 - Girvan-Newman: Edge betweenness centrality
   
Results:
Louvain significantly outperforms Girvan-Newman in modularity and visuals show Louvain's superior community partitioning

Conclusion:
The Louvain algorithm is more efficient and effective for community detection in large social networks compared to Girvan-Newman.
